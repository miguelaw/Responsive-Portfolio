              <p>I’m originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires" target="_blank">Buenos Aires, Argentina</a>, and I came to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank">United States</a> with my family when I was barely 18 years old. At the beginning it was very difficult to adapt to a new culture and way of life because I didn’t speak or understood English. But through hard work and dedication I was able to finish high school <em>(with a 4.0 GPA)</em>, and also College.</p>
              
              <p>The main reason that fueled me to take on this course to become a <a href="https://medium.com/coderbyte/a-guide-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer-in-2017-5c3c08a1600c" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Developer</a> was to make a career change, to add more tools to my current skill set, and to quench my thirst for new knowledge.</p>
              
              <p>Once graduated, I plan on putting all of those new skills combined with my passion, determination and dedication towards creating something new and revolutionary; by thinking “outside-of-the-box” and doing what others have not done.</p>
